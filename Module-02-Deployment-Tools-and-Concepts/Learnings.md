# Week 2 - Session 1

## 💡 1. Containers Provide Isolation

Each container behaves like an independent mini-computer.

---

## 💡 2. Image vs Container

Image → Blueprint  
Container → Running instance  

---

## 💡 3. Port Binding Is Essential

Without port binding:
Browser cannot access container services.

---

## 💡 4. Volume Mounting Prevents Data Loss

Container deleted ≠ Data deleted (if mounted)

This is critical for production systems.

---

## 💡 5. Containers Can Communicate

Using custom networks, containers can:
- Share data
- Make API calls
- Work like microservices

---

## 💡 6. Running LLM Locally Is Possible

We:
- Installed Ollama
- Installed Gemma model
- Generated responses offline

No OpenAI API key required.

---

## 💡 7. Flask + LLM = Real AI Backend

We built:
- Input form
- AI text formatter
- Email generator
- Style transformer

---

## 💡 8. Real-World Architecture Insight

This mirrors industry systems:
- Frontend container
- Backend container
- Model container
- Network bridge

---

## 🚀 Overall Understanding

This session strengthened my understanding of:
- Container lifecycle
- Networking concepts
- Port mapping
- Volume management
- Microservice-style architecture
- AI integration in backend systems
