# Week 1 – Session 1  
## Practical Setup and Environment Preparation

### Platform Familiarization
- Identified the correct portals for:
  - Learning and announcements (Course Portal)
  - Graded submissions (Seek Portal)

### Environment Setup
- Introduction to **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**.
- Understood the importance of Linux environments for data science tasks.

### WSL Installation Overview
- Enabled WSL on a Windows system.
- Installed a Linux distribution.
- Verified installation using terminal commands.
- Prepared the local system for upcoming hands-on exercises.

### Practical Exposure
- Navigated basic command-line interfaces.
- Understood initial environment setup workflows.

> **Note:** Understood how to do everything but couldn't install Ubuntu because of internal system issues.

# Week 1 Session 2

## Objective
To set up a Linux-based development environment and understand the basics of Git-based version control.

---

## Tasks Attempted

### 1. WSL Installation (Windows)
- Followed the official steps to install WSL using PowerShell.
- Enabled required Windows features:
  - Windows Subsystem for Linux
  - Virtual Machine Platform
  - Hypervisor Platform
- Restarted the system multiple times as instructed.

⚠️ **Outcome:**  
Despite multiple attempts, WSL/Ubuntu could not be successfully installed due to system-level issues. The setup process was retried using different methods (PowerShell, Microsoft Store), but the Ubuntu environment could not be stabilized.

### 2. Ubuntu Setup
- Attempted installation of Ubuntu (LTS version) via WSL.
- Faced repeated access/initialization errors during setup.
- Due to these issues, Ubuntu could not be fully configured on the system.

---

### 3. Git (Conceptual Hands-On)
- Understood Git workflow through live demonstration:
  - `git init`
  - `git add`
  - `git commit`
- Observed how Git tracks file changes and enables rollback.
- Learned how Git integrates with GitHub for remote hosting.

---

## Current Status
- WSL/Ubuntu setup: ❌ Not completed (system issue)
- Git concepts: ✅ Understood
- GitHub workflow: ✅ Understood conceptually

---

## Note
Further hands-on practice with Git and Linux commands will be performed once the Linux environment is successfully configured or via an alternative system if required.
