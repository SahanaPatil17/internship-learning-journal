# Week 1 – Session 1  
## Key Learnings

- Gained an understanding of the overall structure and expectations of the TDS course.
- Learned the difference between learning portals and graded submission portals.
- Understood the importance of following assignment submission guidelines.
- Recognized the role of foundational tools in data science workflows.
- Learned why APIs and deployment skills are critical for real-world applications.
- Understood the importance of teamwork and collaboration through projects.
- Gained clarity on the effort required to become industry-ready.
- Learned the purpose and significance of Linux-based environments.

## Problems

- Couldn't install and set up WSL and Ubuntu because of constant virtual disk errors.

# Week 1 - Session 2

## Technical Learnings
- Learned the importance of Linux environments in data science workflows.
- Understood why WSL is preferred over traditional virtual machines.
- Gained clarity on how Linux, Windows, and macOS differ in terminal usage.
- Learned the purpose and structure of Git repositories.
- Understood the relationship between Git (local) and GitHub (remote).

## Conceptual Understanding
- Version control is essential for:
  - Tracking changes
  - Collaboration
  - Backup and recovery
- Git commits act as checkpoints that allow rollback to earlier states.
- GitHub enables collaboration, automation, and deployment workflows.

---

## Challenges Faced
- Unable to complete Ubuntu installation on WSL due to system-level configuration issues.
- Troubleshooting steps were attempted but the issue persisted.
- Recognized that environment setup can be hardware/OS dependent.

---

## Key Takeaways
- Environment setup is a critical first step and may require multiple attempts.
- Even when setup fails, understanding the **concepts** is equally important.
- Linux and Git are industry-standard tools that will be used throughout the course.
- Persistence and debugging are essential skills in technical workflows.

---

## Next Steps
- Retry WSL/Ubuntu setup or use an alternative Linux system if required.
- Practice Git commands through additional guided exercises.
- Prepare for upcoming sessions on GitHub authentication and automation.

#Week 1 - Session 3

## Technical Learnings
- Learned how operating systems boot and how multiple OSes coexist.
- Understood what hypervisors are and why WSL is faster than VirtualBox.
- Gained clarity on Linux file system hierarchy and navigation.
- Learned how Linux and Windows view the same files differently.
- Understood the importance of command-line tools in automation.

---

## Conceptual Learnings
- Linux paths are unified under a single root (`/`).
- Windows drives are mounted inside Linux under `/mnt`.
- Absolute and relative paths determine how files are accessed.
- Terminal-based workflows are critical for automation and scripting.
- AI tools can be accessed directly from the terminal using CLI utilities.

---

## AI Tooling Insights
- `uv` simplifies installation and management of Python-based tools.
- `llm` provides a lightweight interface to interact with:
  - Gemini models
  - GPT models
- API keys act as authentication for model access.
- Environment variables store sensitive configuration securely.

---

## Challenges Faced
- Unable to install or use WSL/Ubuntu due to persistent system issues.
- Could not perform hands-on terminal execution.
- Relied on observation and conceptual understanding instead.

---

## Key Takeaways
- Understanding system internals helps debug environment issues.
- Even without hands-on execution, conceptual clarity is essential.
- Command-line skills are foundational for data science automation.
- Terminal-based AI usage is powerful and efficient.

---

## Next Steps
- Resolve WSL/Ubuntu installation or switch to an alternative Linux setup.
- Practice Linux commands in a functional environment.
- Use `llm` for experimentation once setup is complete.
